Liber Etcetera is a collection of unofficial fan supplements for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th Edition, which seek to expand the rules into new grim and perilous directions!  A collection by Ben "Bee" Scerri, Red World Press (@Ben_Scerri on Twitter).

Beginning with...
Liber Etcetera: Idle Hands, is an unofficial fan supplement for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th Edition, focusing on Downtime between adventures, written by Ben Scerri.
These Downtime rules are intended to replace the Between Adventures rules in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, and the Travel rules in The Enemy Within: The Enemy in Shadows Companion.

Note, these rules specifically don’t make use of the Money to Burn rule in the original Between Adventures, as they were created for a campaign style in which that doesn’t quite make sense. As such, these rules were born to act as a money sink, an impetus to adventure, and a looming threat of disease and class-struggle!
