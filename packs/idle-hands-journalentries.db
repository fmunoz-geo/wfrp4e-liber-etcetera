{"_id":"27AWnEHGpfgHXI17","name":"1. Set-Up","content":"<h2>Step #1: Set-Up </h2>\n<p>At the beginning of a Downtime Phase, three things need to be determined: the Party Endeavour, representing what the group is intending to do for their Downtime as a whole; the length of the Downtime; and the prevailing Weather. </p>\n<h3>Party Endeavours </h3>\n<p>Endeavours represent things the party, and the individual Characters, are performing in their Downtime. These might be resting and recovering, training a new skill, blazing a trail across unknown territory, or the like. Party Endeavours are ones undertaken by the whole party, whilst Personal Endeavours are those undertaken by an individual Character. During Downtime the party as a whole has one Party Endeavour and each member of the party has one-to-three Personal Endeavours (depending on how long the Downtime is). </p>\n<p>There are three Party Endeavours: </p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Undertake a Perilous Journey.</strong> The party journeys from one place to another, risking danger along the way. Their time may be spent hunting, navigating, and scouting ahead. </li>\n<li><strong>Reside in Civilised Lands.</strong> The party stays in relative comfort within the walls of civilisation. Their time may be spent relaxing, learning, and working. Whilst Residing in Civilised Lands, you may also go to the local markets and purchase any items you might need at any point during Downtime. </li>\n<li><strong>Go Our Separate Ways.</strong> The party splits up, forsaking their companionship in return for greater time to themselves. Though this grants an additional Personal Endeavour, the risks of living in the Old World alone are great indeed. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>A Party Endeavour should be undertaken for the whole Downtime. If the party wishes to do two different Party Endeavours — for example, <em>Undertake a Perilous Journey</em> to a new town where they wish to <em>Reside in Civilised Lands</em> — the party needs to perform two different Downtime Phases.</p>\n<h3>Length of Downtime </h3>\n<p>The first step of Downtime is determining how long it lasts for. This may be decided by the GM or the other Players, depending on the nature of previous and future Adventures. Downtime Phases can be<strong> “A Matter of…” </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>“…Days.”</strong> A few days, but less than a week. </li>\n<li><strong>“…Weeks.”</strong> A week or two, but less than a month. </li>\n<li><strong>“…Months.”</strong> A month or two, but less than a season. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>For Downtimes lasting a season or longer, shift back to an Adventure — no matter how minor — to keep things lively. Another long Downtime can be taken after that, if you’re looking to really push through the calendar months! </p>\n<p>The exact length of this Downtime may not be important, but if it is, the GM should feel free to decide within the bounds of Days, Weeks, and Months. Downtimes lasting 3 or 4 days are both <em>A Matter of Days! </em></p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3>Options: Movement &amp; Downtime Length </h3>\n<p>Some groups may prefer a more mechanical approach to determining the length of a Downtime when travelling, incorporating Movement. </p>\n<p>To do this, get a map of the region you are travelling over with a scale, and measure the distance. Characters, Creatures, and Vehicles can travel for 8 hours a day at their Movement miles per hour. </p>\n<p>Simply divide the distance travelled by this value, to determine the amount of days, and fit that number into the above abstraction. Keep in mind that a Warhammer week is 8 days, not 7! </p>\n<p>If Characters wish to travel for more than 8 hours a day, have all Characters and Creatures suffer a −5 penalty to their Well-Being per additional hour, up to a maximum of 12 hours of travel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Weather</h3>\n<p>The Weather in the Empire is fickle, and its shadow casts a pall over the activities of everyone: from peasant to noble alike. At the beginning of Downtime, the GM makes two Weather Tests (Temperature and Precipitation) to determine the prevailing Weather for that stretch of time. This Weather may not persist for the entire stretch of Downtime, but it represents either the most severe, or the average weather.</p>\n<p>Weather is modified by which season it is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Summer.</strong> +20 to Temperature, −20 to Precipitation.</li>\n<li><strong>Autumn.</strong> −10 to Temperature, +20 to Precipitation.</li>\n<li><strong>Winter.</strong> −20 to Temperature, +0 to Precipitation.</li>\n<li><strong>Spring.</strong> +10 to Temperature, +10 to Precipitation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At GM discretion, different locations may have hotter/colder, or drier/wetter seasons. For example, Nehekhara likely adds +30 to all Temperature Tests, and −30 to all Precipitation Tests.</p>\n<h4>Temperature</h4>\n<p>Roll 1d100 + the seasonal modifier.<br />@Macro[XQLmQMqIXwjWegao]{Temperature Table}</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&lt;30: Cold.</strong> Characters who do not have Heavy Clothing during Cold Weather suffer a −10 penalty to their Well-Being Test.</li>\n<li><strong>30–70: Fair.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>&gt;70: Hot.</strong> Characters who do not have Light Clothing during Hot Weather suffer a −10 penalty to their Well-Being Test.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Precipitation</h4>\n<p>Roll 1d100 + the seasonal modifier.<br />@Macro[XQLmQMqIXwjWegao]{Temperature Table}</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&lt;30: Dry. </strong>Forage (Gather or Hunt) Endeavours have a −10 penalty.</li>\n<li><strong>30–70:</strong> Average.</li>\n<li><strong>&gt;70: Wet.</strong> Characters who do not have Waterproof Clothing during Wet Weather suffer a −20 penalty to their Well-Being Test.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Example Weather </h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cold &amp; Dry. </strong>Great wind storms and cold fronts whip the landscape, but the sky is a thin winter blue. </li>\n<li><strong>Cold &amp; Wet. </strong>Torrential rain soaks everyone to the bone, or flurries of snow cover the world in ice. </li>\n<li><strong>Hot &amp; Dry. </strong>Droughts wrack the land as crops shrivel in the fields. </li>\n<li><strong>Hot &amp; Wet. </strong>Humidity rises, and no amount of rain seems to wash the sweat away. </li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Example: Evanswood, Saskia, Hallam, and Grogni have just finished a job in Tussenhof, and wish to travel to Hergig for their next work. The party chooses to Undertake a Perilous Journey, and the GM determines Hergig is A Matter of Weeks away by boat. It’s Autumn, so the GM Tests for Temperature at −10, getting 14: Cold. They Test for Precipitation at +20, getting 71: Wet. The trip is going to be a miserable ride, with the party’s row boat lashed by sheeting rain and flashing storms…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Y0s0C3a99ALda6Sd]{2.

{"_id":"4mknuxotodLg4tSt","name":"4. Living Expenses","content":"<h2>Step #4: Living Expenses</h2>\n<p>Though life might be cheap in the Old World, living can be prohibitively expensive. Between eating and drinking enough provisions to survive, and paying for a dry patch of ground to curl up on cold winter nights, most folk in the Empire are struggling to pay for much else.</p>\n<p>For some, it is less the lure of riches and more the threat of poverty that brings about a life of adventure.</p>\n<h3>Provisions</h3>\n<p>Provisions represent enough food and water to sustain a Character or Creature for a stretch of Downtime. This is an abstracted amount to reduce bookkeeping. The amount of Provisions a Character or Creature requires during a Downtime Phase is based on the length of Downtime, and the Creature’s Size:</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>…Days</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>…Weeks</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>…Months</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Tiny</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Little</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Small*</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Average</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Large</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">16</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">32</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Enormous</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">16</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">32</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">64</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Monstrous</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">32</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">64</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">128</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>*Though <em>Small</em>, adult Halflings count as Average for the purposes of Provisions.</p>\n<p>Each Provision takes up 1 Enc, and costs 2/–. Spare Provisions can be purchased at any time during the Downtime, so long as there is a reasonable place to purchase them. E.g. If the party is in a village, they may purchase Provisions at any time (unless there is a famine or some other calamity in effect). However, if the party is on the open seas, they cannot make this purchase, and will have to buy Provisions before they set out (and hope for the best).</p>\n<p>A Character or Creature that does not consume the required Provisions for a Downtime suffers a −10 penalty to their Well-Being Test at the end of Downtime per Provision skipped. Characters with the Stone Soup Talent only suffer a −5 penalty per Provision skipped.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Example: As the Characters are all Average Size, and they are travelling for A Matter of Weeks, they are required to consume 8 Provisions (or Meals) each. Thankfully they made good time due to a Positive Encounter, so this is reduced to 7. After all of their Foraging and Providing, the party only have 20 Provisions: they’re short by 8! They scrounge together 8 shillings, to purchase 4 of these missing Provisions from some of the taverns they’ve stopped at, and will just have to skip a meal each, taking a −10 penalty to their Well-Being.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Housing</h3>\n<p>In addition to Provisions, a Character must consider their housing during Downtime. There are four choices:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sleeping Rough. </strong>Sometimes a Character must sleep under the stars, or with a canvas “roof” over their heads. Usually this is whilst travelling, but when times are difficult, this might also be done in “civilised” lands. <em>Sleeping Rough</em> whilst <em>Undertaking a Perilous Journey</em> incurs a −20 penalty to one’s Well-Being Test at the end of Downtime, or −10 if the Character has a tent to sleep in. <em>Sleeping Rough</em> whilst <em>Residing in Civilised Lands</em> or <em>Going Separate Ways</em> incurs a −30 penalty, regardless of circumstances.</li>\n<li><strong>Inns &amp; Taverns. </strong>The comfort of roadside inns and taverns is welcome to travellers, so long as they have the coin (and the lands are journeyed enough to support such businesses). Staying in <em>Inns &amp; Taverns</em> costs as many silver shillings as Provisions required for the Downtime Phase.</li>\n<li><strong>Renting a Roof.</strong> Whilst <em>Residing in Civilised Lands</em>, renting a roof to sleep under is the most common way of getting by. Though expensive — indeed, most people spend the majority of their income on food and board — it offers safety from the elements. However, renting is very restricted in the Old World along class lines — both up and down the scale — and one may only rent housing appropriate to their position. <em>Renting a Roof</em> costs coin equal to a Character’s Social Status and Standing per Provision required for the Downtime Phase.</li>\n<li><strong>Living at Home.</strong> Wealth invested in property is the only true way to socially climb in the Old World, regardless of other accolades. If a Character can afford to own a home, and <em>Resides in Civilised Lands</em> where that home is, they may stay there for free for as long as they like, with as many companions as they choose.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Example: Sadly, the rest of the party’s money has to go to lodgings, and the Characters manage to stay out of the weather in the evenings by sleeping in Inns &amp; Taverns for 20 shillings each!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Purchasing, owning, and operating property will be covered fully in an upcoming supplement — <strong>Liber Etcetera: Within the Walls.</strong></p>\n<h3>Bread &amp; Roses</h3>\n<p>Provisions make sure you just get by, but most people in the Old World want to do more than that… They want their bread, but they want their roses too.</p>\n<p>In addition to the personal desire, most people expect their peers to put up appearances as befits their station. In addition to paying for Provisions, each Character may pay an amount of money equal to their Social Class and Status per Personal Endeavour they perform. This represents all the other aspects of life: buying fancier dinners out, gambling and gaming, seeing plays, etc.</p>\n<p>Paying for <em>Bread &amp; Roses</em> provides a +10 bonus to your Well-Being Test.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Example: Grogni, having worked earlier, managed to save up a little something extra, and spends 6 shillings — given his Status is Silver 3, and he performed 2 Personal Endeavours — on Bread &amp; Roses, gaining +10 to his Well-Being.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@JournalEntry[RB4MNCMLXBgHcige]{5.

Well-Being","content":"<h2>Step #5: Well-Being</h2>\n<p>At the end of Downtime, a Character’s Well-Being is determined. Well-Being represents how healthy they are, based on their living conditions and experiences. Make sure to account for Weather and Adventuring Gear, Provisions, and Living Expenses, and then perform a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test per Character and Creature in the party. For each −SL, consult the following list (results are cumulative with all previous effects):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>−1 or 2SL: “You don’t look so great.”</strong> You’re a little under the weather. Perhaps your privation has left you a little thin, your skin a little pale, and you just look generally haggard in demeanour. Suffer a −10 penalty to all Fellowship Tests for the following Adventure.</li>\n<li><strong>−3SL: “Aches and pains.”</strong> Poor sleep, rubbish food, and lingering sniffles has left your body feeling stiff and drained.

You’re sick: there’s no two ways about it. Gain an appropriate Disease (perhaps @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eisitems.K74AhzejwTdzTc1w]{Pneumonia} or the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.txeLd7R13qxSvmsr]{Galloping Trots}).

Additional instances of this must be applied to different Characteristics per Downtime Phase.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Example: Things aren’t looking too great.

The totals add up to:</p>\n<p>Grogni: −20, with a roll of −3SL, meaning Grogni goes into the next Adventure with a −10 penalty to all Fellowship Tests and with the Malaise Symptom.</p>\n<p>Hallam: +0, with a roll of +2SL, meaning he may allocate a single Advance to one of his Characteristics, gaining +1% in Toughness.</p>\n<p>Saskia: −40, with a surpring roll of −0SL, meaning she just scraped by without any harm done.</p>\n<p>Evanswood: −30, with a roll of −5SL, meaning in addition to Grogni’s woes, Evanswood is Wounded and has contracted Pneumonia!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3>It’s All A Little Morbid, Don’t You Think?</h3>\n<p>These rules might be a little harsh, in your opinion.

{"_id":"S4K5JdBswyuLucSs","name":"3. Encounters","content":"<h2>Step #3: Encounters</h2>\n<p>There are two types of Encounters: Positive and Negative. Positive Encounters are those which offer opportunities: an item found, a discovery made, a friend gained, etc. Negative Encounters are those which take away opportunities: an item lost, an unexpected complication arising, a friend lost, or attack befalling the party…</p>\n<p>Both types of Encounters may result from a Downtime, and they are not mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p>The base chance for an Encounter is based on the length of Downtime:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>A Matter of Days</em> has a 10% chance of each.</li>\n<li><em>A Matter of Weeks</em> has a 20% chance of each.</li>\n<li><em>A Matter of Months</em> has a 40% chance of each.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These base chances are modified by the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Residing in Civilised Lands</em> doubles the chances of a Positive Encounter.</li>\n<li>Travelling through, or living in dangerous lands doubles the risk of a Negative Encounter.</li>\n<li><em>Going Our Separate Ways</em> doubles the risk of a Negative Encounter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, the Negative Encounter and the Positive Encounter each occur to only one member of the party (determined by a random roll appropriate for the number of Characters). If a Character specifically <em>Explored</em> whilst <em>Going Our Separate Ways</em>, they get to Test individually for both, and the rest of the group divides up the normal way.</p>\n<p>Encounters will be determined by the GM, depending on the circumstances. Consider the Endeavours the Characters have engaged in when deciding which Encounters to present them with.</p>\n<h3>Example Positive Encounters</h3>\n<h4>A Fortuitous Discovery</h4>\n<p>Whether lost lore hidden in a dusty tome, a treasure map found at the bottom of a barrel of grain, a juicy rumour overheard in an inn, or an ancient temple uncovered along a forgotten trail, the Characters have found something. Whatever it is, it’s worth a lot to the right people. It’s now just a matter of keeping the secret safe, and getting in touch with those who want it (and are willing to pay for it).</p>\n<p>Alternately, this discovery could be important to one of the Characters personally. Consider their Ambitions!</p>\n<h4>Chance Encounters</h4>\n<p>The Characters get the chance to follow up on something that previously slipped through their fingers. Perhaps a thief that escaped their clutches turns up tipsy in the bar they frequent, or a monster they were tracking resurfaces, wounded and alone in a nearby cave. Perhaps that prized sword that was lost in a game of chance comes back to them in the clutches of a pompous fool who needs a good thrashing (and a spot of ‘resource redistribution’).</p>\n<p>This is a good Encounter to use if the Characters missed, for whatever reason, a piece of content that was previously planned. A favourite NPC can be reintroduced, or a special trapping can once more be dangled in front of their noses.</p>\n<h4>Favours Between Friends</h4>\n<p>A friend offers or asks for a Favour. It’s only something small, but it ties into what else is happening, and opens other opportunities. Perhaps your criminal friend offers to introduce you to their boss, or a merchant friend recommends you purchase shares in lumber or iron or some other resource due to changes in the marketplace.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the Characters are offered the chance to perform a Favour for someone, turning a mere contact into a fast friend who can help them in other matters.</p>\n<h4>Random Acts</h4>\n<p>In the course of everyone’s life, we are the recipients of random acts of kindness: even in a place as downtrodden and dark as the Empire of Sigmar Heldenhammer! The Characters are lucky, this time around, and what might seem a minor act for someone else, turns out to be a boon indeed. Perhaps a hunter left a winter lodge stocked with extra firewood and rations for the next traveller, allowing the Characters to shrug off the effects of Exposure or Sleeping Rough. Perhaps a wealthy benefactor donates a few extra beds to the Temple of Shallya, and they have enough resources to treat the Characters’ cuts and colds pro bono. Perhaps a guard, fed up with his terrible employers, decides not to issue a beating commanded by a noble lord, and the party’s thief gets away scot-free!</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the Characters may have been the ones to perform a random act of kindness. This might be nothing more than an NPC they’ve met before — or an entirely new one — coming to them and confessing how their actions have improved their life. Little bits of encouragement can mean everything in a place like the Old World. Of course, if the NPC comes with gifts or other thanks, that’s not to be turned down!</p>\n<h4>Short Cuts &amp; Smooth Sailing</h4>\n<p>Whether it’s a spot of luck on the navigator’s part, a favourable wind filling their sails, or a helpful tip from a local, the Characters make excellent time on their journey. This could result in a few days being shaved off the travel, represented by a few less Provisions being needed, the Characters could catch up to a quarry they have been chasing, or even they arrive before the true troubles have started up for their next adventure, giving them some time to get grounded in the new locale.</p>\n<p>Alternately, something the Characters have been waiting for — perhaps a commissioned item, or a returning ally — catches the good tidings, and that windfall arrives much earlier than expected!</p>\n<h3>Example Negative Encounters</h3>\n<h4>A Sudden Storm</h4>\n<p>During a period of bad weather, storms can flare up that threaten the party. Perhaps the cold results in terrible hail, or weeks of drought have caused a dust storm. Whatever it is, it presents a difficulty that can be moved through or waited out.</p>\n<p>If the Characters press on, they may risk Exposure, or you might double the penalties for sleeping outside. If the latter is chosen, consider that inns and taverns on the road — if there are any — would be especially full, so prices may have increased, or rooms might not be available at all.</p>\n<p>If the Characters choose to wait out the storm, increase the number of Provisions needed by +1 (or more).</p>\n<h4>Bandits on the Road</h4>\n<p>Bandits are all too common in the Empire: deserters from the State Armies, hunters whose whole lives have been upended by Beastmen, or simply folk looking to profit off of suffering. Whatever drove them to a life of crime is largely unimportant, for now they want to drive swords into the bellies of the Characters! Perhaps they can be reasoned or bartered with. Or perhaps they will have to be met with cold steel.</p>\n<p>And perhaps, still, they’re more than mere bandits. Chaos Marauders, Beastmen, Greenskins, and worse are roaming the land, after all.</p>\n<h4>Dangerous Terrain</h4>\n<p>For whatever reason, the region itself is unsafe to travel through. Avalanches on mountain slopes, mudslides after heavy rains, and flooding on lowlands are all perils of the wilds. The Characters will need to think quickly, perhaps performing <strong>Hard (−20) Athletics</strong> Tests to outrun tumbling snow, or stressful <strong>Very</strong> <strong>Hard (−30) Climb</strong> Tests to scale trees as mud rushes down to the river. Once the Characters are safe, they’ll have to figure out what to do next: press on, or turn back?</p>\n<h4>The Thief in the Night</h4>\n<p>Maybe it was the peddlers who stopped at your camp fire the evening just past, or perhaps it was the man you let get a little too close at the last tavern, but someone has taken something precious to you. Randomly decide (by dice) which Character to target, and remove a Trapping from them of 0 Enc with the highest value from their equipment.</p>\n<p>The party could turn back and search for the thief, perhaps adding a handful of days (and a few Provisions more) to their journey, or they could accept that Ranald’s fingers are everywhere, and what goes around comes around.</p>\n<h4>Unfortunate Entanglements</h4>\n<p>A friend is in trouble, and needs your help, or perhaps a job you thought finished has turned up incomplete. Whatever the problem is, you’re expected to solve it. Ignoring your obligations could breed bad blood with the wrong sort of folk, but who knows what you’ll have to do to make amends. Treat this as owing someone a Favour (of a relevant scale), and they’ve come to collect pronto.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Example: After performing their last few Personal Endeavours, the GM checks for any Encounters. Given it is A Matter of Weeks, and the River Talabec is being patrolled by pirates in recent times, the GM rules the chances for Positive Encounters are 20% and Negative 40%. Both are checked, and both occur! The GM decides that the Characters manage to find a safer channel through the storms where the rain isn’t so bad, causing them to make great time (one fewer Provision needed per Character), but dreaded river pirates are also making use of such measures, and the party are ambushed on the water! Canons fire into the water surrounding the row boat, and before they know it, they are beset by raiders!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">@JournalEntry[4. Living Expenses]{4.

{"_id":"Y0s0C3a99ALda6Sd","name":"2. Personal Endeavours","content":"<h2>Step #2: Personal Endeavours</h2>\n<p>Whilst Party Endeavours represent what the group as a whole is doing, Personal Endeavours represent actions individuals in the party make during their free time. The amount of Personal Endeavours each</p>\n<p>Character gets is based on the length of Downtime:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 Personal Endeavour for <em>A Matter of Days</em>.</li>\n<li>2 Personal Endeavours for <em>A Matter of Weeks</em>.</li>\n<li>3 Personal Endeavours for <em>A Matter of Months</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the party is <em>Going Their Separate Ways</em>, each Character gains an additional Personal Endeavour.</p>\n<p>Personal Endeavours may be performed in any order the party wishes.</p>\n<p>Some Personal Endeavours make more or less sense depending on the Party Endeavour you have chosen. It is up to the circumstances of the moment which are and are not possible / relevant. For example, no Endeavours that refer to another member of one’s party may be taken if the Characters <em>Go Their Separate Ways</em>. Additionally, the mode of travel chosen whilst <em>Undertaking a Perilous Journey</em> should be considered: it’s difficult to gather berries whilst sailing in a galleon!</p>\n<p>Note: Benefits from Endeavours ‘stack’ if they are performed multiple times or my multiple Characters. For example, if in a party of four, every Character performs the <em>Tend</em> Endeavour, every Character gains a +30 to their Well-Being.</p>\n<p><strong>List: Antagonise, Befriend, Carouse, Craft, Explore, Forage, Gossip, Learn, Navigate, Practice, Provide, Research, Rest, Scout, Shelter, Teach, Tend, Training, Work</strong></p>\n<h4>Antagonise</h4>\n<p>You spend time spreading rumours, vicious lies, or uncomfortable truths about a particular target to besmirch their name. Perform a <strong>Challenging (+0) Gossip</strong> or <strong>Charm</strong> Test, modified by the viability of the rumour or strength of the evidence (real or manufactured), and the difference in Social Status and Standing. The target’s Social Standing counts as 1 less per +SL scored. This may have additional effects. If the target is aware of your campaign to besmirch their name, the Test may be Opposed.</p>\n<h4>Befriend</h4>\n<p>You spend time making contact with someone, attempting to turn them from an acquaintance into a friend. Perform a <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm</strong> Test, modified by circumstances, and the target’s Social Status and Standing. On a Success, the target becomes a contact of yours who you can freely access. On 5 or more SL, the target becomes a Friend, who will happily perform Favours for you with no need for repayment. <em>Befriend</em> Endeavours can become Extended Tests, if you wish to work on them over multiple Downtime Phases.</p>\n<h4>Carouse</h4>\n<p>You spend time drinking with the locals, or playing cards, etc. Perform an <strong>Average (+20) Consume Alcohol</strong>, or <strong>Challenging (+0) Gossip</strong> Test. You may gain the effects of an Advance in the Etiquette (Social Group) Talent for the purposes of the following Adventure.</p>\n<h4>Craft</h4>\n<p>Provided you have the appropriate materials, tools, and facilities, you are able to set to the task of crafting any trapping you desire. Convert the cost of the trapping you wish to create into silver shillings, rounded up and halved, which becomes the target SL. Halve this value again for the cost in materials, if they cannot be gathered from a local area for free (clay, found wood, etc.). Perform an <strong>Extended Challenging (+0) Trade </strong>(<em>Any</em>) Test, modified by your circumstances. Negative SL are not counted for this Extended Test, though a Fumble means materials are wasted.</p>\n<h4>Explore</h4>\n<p>You spend additional time going off-road or looking about as you travel, increasing your chances of finding something. Double the chances for a Positive and Negative Encounter. Perform a <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore </strong>(<em>Relevant</em>), <strong>Navigate</strong>, <strong>Stealth </strong>(<em>Relevant</em>), or <strong>Track</strong> Test to increase the chances of a Positive Encounter by +10, with an additional +5 per +SL.</p>\n<h4>Forage</h4>\n<p>You forage for provisions. Pick Hunt, Fish, or Gather, and perform an <strong>Challenging (+0) Outdoor Survival</strong> or <strong>Track</strong> Test if you have appropriate gear, modified by the terrain (<em>Barren</em> (−20), <em>Normal</em> (+0), or <em>Verdant</em> (+20)) and <em>Dry Weather</em> (−10). Fishing is not affected by bad weather. Gain 1 Provision on a Successful Test, +1 per +SL. Double the number of Provisions generated when Hunting.</p>\n<p>Hunting with a ranged weapon other than a Hunting Bow (see @JournalEntry[CsJAyjMek5tC2sE0]{Appendix}) or a Hochland Long Rifle is detrimental to the meat, due to unnecessary damage, or arrows/bolts passing right through. Such misuse incurs a −10 penalty.</p>\n<h4>Gossip</h4>\n<p>You spend time rubbing elbows with the locals, around campfires, with passing ships’ crews, or in taverns, learning information about the local area. Perform a <strong>Challenging (+0) Gossip</strong> Test. You may ask the GM one question per +SL, which is answered truthfully, given the information available.</p>\n<h4>Learn</h4>\n<p>You seek out knowledge of Skills and Talents that you do not yet know. Supposing you can find a teacher (perhaps by <em>Befriending</em> one), you may pay them an amount of money equal to their Social Status and Standing to gain access to special training, learning from them a Skill or Talent you otherwise wouldn’t be able to purchase. Doing so costs twice the normal XP to Advance. You cannot Advance these Skills or Talents further until you perform this Endeavour again. This Endeavour allows you to purchase a Talent multiple times, so long as your teacher has at least that many Advances in the Talent. You cannot learn Talents with the Max: 1 restriction, unless ruled otherwise. Note, if you are <em>Learning</em> from a companion who fails their Test, this Endeavour is wasted, but no XP is spent.</p>\n<h4>Navigate</h4>\n<p>You spend time making sure the party stays on track for the whole journey, navigating around poor roads and waterways that would slow you down. Perform a <strong>Challenging (+0) Navigation</strong> Test, reducing the required Provisions per Character and Creature for the journey by −1 per +2 SL scored, to a minimum of half the original amount.</p>\n<h4>Practice</h4>\n<p>You set your mind to practicing a skill during your free time. Choose a single Skill which makes sense for you to be able to practice. Perform an <strong>Average (+20)</strong> Test using that Skill. On a Success, you may choose to re-roll a failed Test using that Skill before the next Downtime. This re-roll is in addition to Fortune Points or Dark Deals.</p>\n<h4>Provide</h4>\n<p>You provide for your companions. Perform an <strong>Easy (+40) Trade (Cook)</strong> Test to make more food from raw ingredients (turning bones into soup, seeds into porridge, etc.). For each +SL scored, convert 1 Provision into 2 Meals. This can only be performed on Provisions that already exist: scoring +4SL when you only have 3 Provisions will create 6 Meals! For each −2SL, destroy 1 Provision. Meals can be eaten the same as Provisions, though they cannot be converted into more Meals using the <em>Provide</em> Endeavour, obviously.</p>\n<h4>Research</h4>\n<p>You spend time researching a topic of study. So long as you have a library to work from, or experts to consult, you may perform an <strong>Average (+20) Research</strong> Test, or <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore </strong>(<em>Various</em>) Test using a relevant Lore. You may ask the GM one question per +SL. The GM must reply truthfully, given the information available.</p>\n<h4>Rest</h4>\n<p>You forgo other activities to rest and recuperate. You count as Resting for the purposes of healing. You cannot Rest whilst <em>Undertaking a Perilous Journey</em>, unless your party has a litter, coach, or boat for you to ride in comfortably.</p>\n<h4>Scout</h4>\n<p>You range ahead of your companions, scouting for hidden dangers. Perform an <strong>Average (+20) Track</strong>, or <strong>Challenging (+0) Stealth </strong>(<em>Relevant</em>) Test. Success grants forewarning of any Encounters (Positive or Negative), which can be avoided by spending an extra Provision per Character and Creature as the party takes time to navigate around the Encounter. Per +2SL, you may ask a follow-up question about the Encounter, or choose to set an ambush.</p>\n<h4>Shelter</h4>\n<p>With your understanding of the wilds, you provide a safe and dry shelter, mitigating the worst effects of any adverse weather. Perform a <strong>Challenging (+0) Outdoor Survival</strong> Test, modified by −10 per Weather effect present: Cold, Hot, Dry, and Wet. On a Success, you may mitigate a single Weather effect for you and your companions.</p>\n<h4>Teach</h4>\n<p>You instruct a comrade in a certain task. Perform a <strong>Challenging (+0) Entertain (Storytelling)</strong> or <strong>Lore </strong>(<em>Relevant</em>), or a <strong>Very Hard (−30)</strong> Test using an appropriate Characteristic or Skill. On a Success, you may freely teach the use of a Skill or Talent you know to a companion who is performing the Learn Endeavour. They do not need to spend money (though you may still ask it of them, naturally), but must spend XP as described. You cannot teach Talents with the Max: 1 restriction, unless ruled otherwise.</p>\n<h4>Tend</h4>\n<p>You spend time tending to the Wounds of your companions. You may perform a <strong>Challenging (+0) Heal</strong> Test on one or more Characters or Creatures. Alternatively, you may perform an <strong>Average (+20) Heal</strong>, or <strong>Challenging (+0) Outdoor Survival</strong> Test to grant all companions (but not yourself!) a +10 bonus to their Well-Being Test.</p>\n<h4>Training</h4>\n<p>You spend time teaching one of your animals new tricks. Perform a <strong>Challenging (+0) Animal Training</strong> Test. If Successful, choose one of the <em>Trained (Various)</em> Creature Traits to teach the animal. Some animals are difficult to train — due to their simpleminded nature, or their stubbornness — and may need to pass either an Intelligence Test with a +10 bonus per +SL scored on the Animal Training Test, or may even Oppose the Animal Training Test with their Willpower.</p>\n<h4>Work</h4>\n<p>You spend your time actually doing your job. Perform an <strong>Average (+20)</strong> Test using your Income Skill, based on your Career. On a Success, earn money based on your Social Class and Standing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brass</strong> earns @Roll[2d10] pennies per Standing.</li>\n<li><strong>Silver</strong> earns @Roll[1d10] shillings per Standing.</li>\n<li><strong>Gold</strong> earns 1 GC per Standing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For every +/−2SL, count your Standing as being +/−1 its usual value for these purposes. Some jobs may be impossible to perform whilst <em>Undertaking a Perilous Journey</em>, or whilst <em>Residing in Civilised Lands</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Example: Given the party is travelling for A Matter of Weeks, they each have 2 Personal Endeavours, but are constrained by the fact they are on the River Talabec (though it can be assumed they have time to stop at riverside taverns, and dock in small hamlets along the way).</p>\n<p>Grogni, a Pit Fighter, decides to Work whilst he stops in the evenings, wrestling with sailors and fishermen from the local villages for drinking money. He performs an Average (+20) Melee (Brawling) Test, scoring +2SL, so counts his Social Class as Silver 3 instead of 2. He rolls 3d10, earning 17 silver shillings.</p>\n<p>Evanswood, usually one to scout ahead, is constrained by the fact the party only has one boat, so decides instead to spend his time fishing, performing the Forage (Fish) Endeavour. He has a fishing rod and net, and the GM determines the River Talabec is neither Barren nor Verdant, so he makes a Challenging (+0) Outdoor Survival Test, scoring +3SL!</p>\n<p>Evanswood managed to catch 1 Provision, plus an additional 3 more for a total of 4 Provisions — a nice haul!</p>\n<p>Hallam, being a pragmatic fellow, rummages through the party’s bags and discovers that even with Evanswood’s impressive fishing skills, they are still light on food. Setting his trusty cast iron pan over the brazier burning in the middle of the row boat, he performs the Provide Endeavour. Hallam rolls a massive +8SL on his Easy (+40) Trade (Cook) Test, which would convert 8 Provisions into 16 Meals, but sadly the party only has 5, including Evanswood’s catch. These 5 are prepared into 10 Meals, and Hallam looks worried.</p>\n<p>Saskia, on the other hand, is worried for different reasons. The party is rather exposed: they’re not dressed for the elements, and the elements are certainly giving them all what-for. Sadly, her Outdoor Survival Skill as a Warrior Priest is woeful, so instead of performing the Shelter Endeavour, she Tends to the party. She rolls a Success on her Average (+20) Heal Test, granting everyone in the boat a +10 to their Well-Being. She spends her time making hot tea, and rotating towels over the brazier to dry in an attempt to keep her companions in good stead. However, she herself remains bare to the elements.</p>\n<p>The Characters each have one more Personal Endeavour. They look to the grey skies, clutch at their rumbling stomachs, and consider their options.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@JournalEntry[S4K5JdBswyuLucSs]{3.
